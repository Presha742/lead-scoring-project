The Lead Scoring Project aimed to predict which leads (potential customers) were most likely to convert into paying customers based on demographic, behavioral, and interaction data. This prediction allows marketing and sales teams to optimize campaigns and target high-potential leads. The goal was to improve marketing and sales efficiency by prioritizing high-quality leads.

Project Objectives:
- To improve sales and marketing alignment.
- To use predictive analytics for identifying potential customers.
- To enhance revenue generation by focusing on leads with higher conversion probability.
- Identify key features that influence lead conversion.
- Develop a predictive scoring system using machine learning.
- Improve conversion rates through data-driven prioritization.
- Demonstrate the value of ML in automating decision-making.

Project Methodology:
1. Data Collection and Understanding: 
The dataset (Leads.xls) consisted of customer information such as demographics, interactions, and purchase behavior. The dataset used (Leads.xls) contained customer demographics, lead source information, website interactions, and historical conversion outcomes.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
 Missing values were handled through imputation, duplicate data was removed, and categorical features were encoded. Removed duplicates and irrelevant features, handled missing values, encoded categorical data using label and one-hot encoding, and normalized numerical.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 Patterns and correlations between variables were visualized to understand customer behavior trends. EDA was performed to uncover insights and patterns. For example, leads coming from social media channels showed higher conversion rates. Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to identify correlations and feature importance.
4. Feature Selection: 
The most significant features influencing conversion were selected using feature importance analysis from Random Forest models. Techniques like correlation matrices and Random Forest feature importance were applied to select the most relevant predictors of conversion.
5. Model Building and Training: 
Machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Classifier were implemented to train the model on labeled data. Several supervised learning algorithms were tested, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier. Random Forest performed best due to its robustness and resistance to overfitting.



6. Model Evaluation: 
The performance was evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, and Confusion Matrix to ensure reliability and precision. Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. ROC-AUC curve analysis and Confusion Matrix helped interpret performance.

Outcome: 
The final model was able to predict the likelihood of a lead converting into a customer with high accuracy, helping optimize sales strategies and resource allocation.

Result Interpretation:
The model successfully predicted lead conversion with high accuracy. Business insights were presented as visual dashboards, helping marketing teams understand which customer attributes contributed most to conversions
